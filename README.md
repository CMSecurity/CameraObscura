Camera**Obscura** - IP Cam Honeypot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RoastingMalware/CameraObscura.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RoastingMalware/CameraObscura)

IP Cameras are often misused for wide range malware campaigns. The purpose of this project is to fake a IP Camera with the common features, such as camera stream, login or firmware upload to protocolize actions done by botnets.

> This project is currently under development. Most of the features are not implemented yet.

> For God's sake, don't deploy this to productive environments. It's an honeypot which also could be exploited.

## (planned) Features

- [ ] Fake Camera Endpoint (for HTTP `POST`/ `GET` etc.)

- [ ] Fake other services (like RTSP)
  - [ ] RTSP 
  - [ ] SSH/ Telnet (using cowrie)
- [ ] Configuration
  - [x] Company Logos (via config/templates)
  - [ ] Service/ Port redirect
  - [x] Routes
- [ ] Deployment/ Analysis/ Usage
  - [ ] CLI Commands (like `start` or `restart`)

  - [ ] Splunk/ ELK Usage
  - [ ] Upgrade process

## Requirements

Python3

## Recommendations

- Don't run the honeypot as root
- Don't run the honeypot on a productive environment
- Use a dedicated, isolated environment (like `qemu`, `lxd`, `lxc` or `docker`)
- It's still in development :)
